Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in \\n2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, \\nand strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average, \\nboosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing \\nreforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will \\nlikely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.  \\nWith lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in \\n2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses \\nmoderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively, \\nboth the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share \\nof GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. \\nBanks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to \\n20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. \\nSince the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities, \\nbanks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average \\nmaturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio \\nremained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is \\nrelatively high at above 80 percent.     \\nQatar has started to implement the ambitious Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to \\nbuild a more diversified, knowledge-based and private sector-driven economy. Guided by \\nNDS3, reform momentum has strengthened significantly, including to attract and retain high-\\nskilled expatriate workers, foster innovation, promote public-private partnerships, and further \\nimprove the business efficiency. Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI for \\nproductivity gains, and the nation’s climate agenda is advancing.  \\nRisks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Main downside risks stem from the global \\nheadwinds, including a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in \\nglobal financial conditions and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical \\ntensions. The regional conflict has had limited impact on Qatar but adds further to the \\ndownside risks through lower tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon \\n1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.

Domestic downside risk stems mainly from further weaknesses in the real estate \\nsector, although strong tourism and policy measures introduced in 2023 could mitigate the \\nrisk.

Directors agreed that maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and \\naccelerating reform efforts would further solidify macroeconomic stability and resilience to \\nshocks while boosting prosperity. \\nDirectors commended the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence and called for \\naccelerating fiscal reforms. They recommended adopting a medium-term fiscal anchor to help \\nensure intergenerational equity, and reiterated the need to accelerate revenue diversification, \\nparticularly by introducing the value-added tax. Directors highlighted the importance of \\nimproving spending efficiency and composition, particularly by enhancing public investment \\nmanagement. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions and adopt a \\nfull-fledged medium-term fiscal framework with enhanced fiscal risk management.  \\nDirectors supported the authorities’ efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic \\nfinancial markets, while encouraging them to consider undertaking a Financial Sector \\nAssessment Program update. They welcomed the newly introduced risk-based supervision \\nand recommended formalizing the financial safety net and continuing to adjust \\nmacroprudential policies to mitigate potential macro-financial risks. Directors encouraged the \\nauthorities to sustain their progress in fighting financial crimes.  \\nDirectors agreed that the exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. They concurred \\nthat, as conditions allow, strengthening the operational framework would further enhance \\nmonetary policy transmission.  \\nDirectors supported the authorities’ strategy to build a more diversified, private sector-led, and \\nknowledge-based economy. They recommended fostering innovation and business efficiency \\nand enhancing human capital by attracting and retaining more high-skilled expatriate workers, \\nimproving Qatari nationals’ employment in the private sector, and further increasing female \\nlabor force participation. Directors agreed that aligning domestic energy prices with export \\nprices would benefit public finances and support climate goals. They also encouraged the \\nauthorities to close remaining data gaps, with the help of IMF capacity development. \\n2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chair of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and \\nthis summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to \\nlower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform \\nmomentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). \\nOutlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium-\\nterm outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and \\nreform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far \\nbeen resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall. \\nQatar’s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks. \\nFiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The \\npositive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to \\nintroduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending \\nefficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient \\nspending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term \\nfiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will \\nenhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency \\nand risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy.  \\nMonetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country \\nwell. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the \\nrecent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and \\nformalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding \\nthrough market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks’ exposure to short-term \\nforeign funding. Strong efforts to improve AML/CFT effectiveness should continue. \\nStructural reforms: Successful NDS3 implementation requires proper reform prioritization \\nand inter-agency coordination. Priorities include to enhance human capital and innovation, \\npromote trade diversification and FDI (with domestic knowledge spillovers) and further \\nimprove business efficiency, especially access to finance. Qatar is well positioned to \\nleverage digitalization and AI for productivity gains. Accelerating climate actions can \\nstrengthen sustainability and generate “green” growth. Policies targeting specific sectors or \\neconomic zones should be managed carefully. Statistics should continue to improve.   \\nJanuary 8, 2025'),\n",

Qatar has started the implementation of the much anticipated Third National \\nDevelopment Strategy (NDS3) to chart a new course for economic transformation (Text \\nFigure 1). Driven by significant public infrastructure investment over the last decade, Qatar’s non-\\nhydrocarbon economy has grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output. Diversification \\nin fiscal revenue and exports, however, has progressed more slowly. The trend decline in total factor \\nproductivity has also been a drag to economic growth. Acknowledging these challenges, NDS3 \\n(launched in January 2024) calls for a decisive transition from the costly state-driven growth model \\nto a private sector-led one, with the state becoming an enabler. NDS3 is reform-focused, aiming to \\nbuild a more sustainable and knowledge-based economy, with ambitious targets set and \\n“diversification clusters” identified to build comparative advantages (Annex I). Reform momentum \\nhas strengthened significantly since the launch of NDS3.  \\n Text Figure 1.

Domestic financial conditions tightened, while monetary policy easing started in \\nSeptember 2024 (Figure 2 and Text Figure 4). The QCB continued to follow the US Federal Reserve \\nin setting policy rates and improved liquidity management through calibrated T-bill issuance. As \\nhydrocarbon prices moderated, the associated liquidity to the banking sector decreased. Bank \\nlending to domestic private sector eased to 5 percent (year-on-year) in 2023 while credit to the \\npublic sector contracted after major World Cup-related infrastructure projects were completed. \\nDomestic credit accelerated in 2024 so far as private credit to services and trade strengthened, and \\npositive public credit growth resumed to support investment projects. Credit to the real estate \\nsector contracted (year-on-year) earlier in 2024 but grew from August.  \\n5.      The current account surplus narrowed mainly on lower hydrocarbon prices (Figure 3 \\nand Text Figure 5). The current account surplus shrank from 27 percent of GDP in 2022 to a still \\nsizeable 17 percent of GDP in 2023. The trade surplus moderated further in 2024 as hydrocarbon \\nexport continued to decline. On the other hand, tourism and transportation services were buoyant, \\nand remittance outflows remained stable despite a rise in expatriate employment. The QCB’s \\ninternational reserves rose gradually to US$53.8 billion in November 2024, strengthening the reserve \\ncoverage (projected to reach 62 percent of the ARA metric by end 2024). This is complemented by \\nthe sizeable foreign assets held by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), estimated to have exceeded \\n200 percent of GDP in 2023, through which a significant share of the hydrocarbon windfalls is \\ninvested abroad.

Growth is expected to strengthen gradually in the near term and pick up more \\nforcefully over the medium term. Real GDP growth is projected to improve to 2 percent in 2024–\\n25, in line with staff’s nowcasting estimates \\n(Text Figure 7 and Annex III), as non-\\nhydrocarbon growth gradually increases, \\nsupported by public investment, spillovers \\nfrom the ongoing LNG expansion project, and \\nstrong tourism. Monetary policy easing will \\nlikely accelerate domestic credit growth and \\nbolster broader economic activities. Medium-\\nterm growth is expected to accelerate (to an \\naverage of around 4¾ percent) on the back \\nof massive North Field LNG production \\nexpansion (a cumulative increase of around \\n85 percent by 2030), and initial NDS3 reform \\ngains. Headline inflation will likely ease to \\n1 percent in 2024, before converging to \\n2 percent over the medium term as monetary policy eases and growth strengthens. \\n9.      The external and fiscal surpluses will likely remain, albeit declining as a share of GDP. \\nQatar’s LNG production expansion is set to generate significant hydrocarbon revenues and maintain \\nthe twin surpluses, assuming continued fiscal discipline. The surpluses (in percent of GDP), however, \\nare projected to moderate over the medium term as hydrocarbon prices are expected to soften. \\nCentral government debt is set to gradually decline to around 36 percent of GDP by 2029. Qatar is \\nassessed to have a low overall risk of sovereign stress (Annex IV). \\n10.      Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced (Annex V). Main external downside risks include \\na sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in global financial conditions \\nand commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical tensions. The regional conflict has had \\nlimited impact on Qatar, but adds further to the downside risks with potential impact through lower \\ntourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon prices. Domestic downside risk stems \\nmainly from further weaknesses in the real estate sector, while the risk could be mitigated by the \\nproper implementation of the measures introduced in 2023 to enhance transparency and regulation \\nof real estate activities\\n2 as well as strong tourism. Over the medium and long term, the expected \\nsignificant expansion of global natural gas supply could exert downward price pressures, although \\nQatar’s low production cost and proven reliability could mitigate the impact (Text Figure 8).3 Other \\nkey downside risks include worsening climate stressors and a disorderly global energy transition.

Fiscal Policy: Enhance Resilience and Support Diversification  \\n13.       The authorities plan to resume gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024. Despite a \\nmoderate fiscal loosening in 2023 amid slower growth, the NHPB is estimated to remain consistent \\nwith the level suggested by the Permanent \\nIncome Hypothesis (PIH), a benchmark to \\nensure intergenerational equity (Text \\nFigure 9). 4 The 2024 budget envisages \\nspending cuts worth 2 ppts of GDP from \\nthe 2023 outturn, mostly in capital \\nexpenditure, while the fiscal outturn up to \\nthe third quarter of 2024 suggests that the \\noverall expenditure cuts could be milder \\nthan budgeted, closer to 1½ ppts pf GDP. \\nNonetheless, the fiscal stance is still likely \\nto tighten, with the NHPB projected to \\nimprove by around ¾ ppt of non-\\nhydrocarbon GDP. The 2025 budget \\nenvisages broadly prudent spending plans \\namid the growth rebound. The medium-\\nterm budget has been updated to reflect \\nNDS3 spending needs, where continued \\ngradual consolidation is expected.  \\n14.      Staff welcomed the authorities’ \\ncommitment to continued fiscal \\nprudence and recommended adopting a \\nfiscal anchor to support the strategy. \\nThe PIH-based benchmark can serve as a \\nmedium-term fiscal anchor to ensure intergenerational equity. Higher-than-expected hydrocarbon \\nrevenues should be saved to strengthen fiscal buffers.

The PIH-based fiscal anchor should be updated \\nperiodically as the global energy transition unfolds to ensure realistic long-term oil price \\nassumptions. \\n15.

Qatar’s fiscal multipliers over the last three \\ndecades are estimated to be stronger than those in other GCC countries, especially for capital \\nexpenditure. However, multipliers have fallen as the investment cycle from the World Cup \\nmatured, suggesting more limited returns from future public infrastructure investment (Box I). \\nMeanwhile, investment to build a knowledge-based economy, including to leverage Qatar’s \\nadvanced digital access and readiness to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) (see Section D), and \\nenhance climate resilience and sustainability, could generate high returns, not only in terms of \\ndirect growth gains, but also in creating an enabling environment for the private sector.9  Any \\npublic sector-driven initiatives to promote private sector development should avoid supporting \\nunviable firms. Meanwhile, as Qatar undertakes necessary fiscal reforms, such as introducing the \\nVAT and gradually phasing out subsidies, targeted transfers to vulnerable households are \\nimportant to strengthen social protection.   \\n• Strengthen public investment management. IMF estimates suggest that the most efficient \\npublic investors can achieve twice the growth impact from their investment than the least \\nefficient ones.10 Staff’s past analysis suggests room to further improve Qatar’s public investment \\nefficiency. As new investment will be undertaken to support NDS3, the authorities could benefit \\nfrom the IMF’s Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) and/or Climate-PIMA.  \\nBox 1. Estimating Fiscal Multipliers in Qatar and the GCC \\nThis box estimates fiscal multipliers in Qatar and its GCC peers over the past three decades.1 This \\nanalysis examines fiscal multipliers, defined as the non-hydrocarbon growth gains from government \\nspending, from different expenditures over time, with a special attention to the level of capital stock to \\ncapture the potential negative impact of excessive use of seemingly productive expenditures (Devarajan et \\nal., 1996). Our empirical strategy broadly follows Espinoza et al. (2011) and Fouejieu et al (2018) with both a \\nGCC panel estimate (and teasing out Qatar-specific effects) and a single-country time-series analysis for \\nQatar. \\nGenerally, Qatar had stronger fiscal multipliers than its GCC peers, but the gains from capital \\nexpenditure weakened when capital stock became relatively high. Results from cross-GCC panel \\nregression suggest that for the GCC, the average long-run fiscal multiplier for capital expenditure (0.7) is \\nstronger and more persistent than that for current expenditure (statistically insignificant), although the \\ngrowth gains from the former emerge with a lag. The Qatar-specific long-term cumulative multiplier for \\ncapital expenditure (based on the GCC panel regression and a country dummy for Qatar) is close to 1.5. \\nWhen capital stock is relatively high, however, the capital spending multipliers for both Qatar and the GCC \\nbecome insignificant. \\nA further analysis confirms how growth gains from capital spending in Qatar waned when the \\ninfrastructure investment cycle appeared to have matured (Box Figure 1-1). Using a single-county \\napproach, time-varying fiscal multipliers from capital spending in Qatar are estimated on a 12-year rolling \\nbasis. Results suggest that World Cup-related capital spending in the 2010s had stronger (first panel) and \\nmore persistent (second panel) growth impact than previous public investment. These may reflect a more \\ncomprehensive infrastructure investment strategy and/or higher spending efficiency.\\n2 However, as the \\ninfrastructure investment cycle started to mature, the growth effects moderated.  \\n \\n9 Annex VII.

To this end, the authorities noted\\ngood progress in expanding program-based budgeting to eventually cover all sectors by 2025, and\\ne\\nxpected that the ongoing expenditure review would generate savings in the medium term.

Financial Sector Policy: Maintain Stability and Deepen Markets\\n20. Vigilant QCB policies have helped secure financial stability, while pockets of\\nvulnerabilities warrant continued diligence (Figure 5). The banking sector remains healthy despite\\nthe growth normalization and tighter financial conditions, thanks to robust buffers, diligent QCB\\npolicies and ample hydrocarbon liquidity. Recent QCB measures to reduce banks’ short-term foreign\\na\\nsset-liability mismatches and risks in their exposure to a weaker real estate market are welcome,\\ne\\nspecially as easing global financial conditions could stimulate foreign funding by banks and real\\nestate companies. The QCB should make more granular data (e.g., the average maturity structure of\\nbanking sector foreign assets and liabilities, NPLs by sector) available to enhance monitoring and\\nf\\nacilitate risk assessment. The NPL ratio will likely remain contained as economic activity picks up\\nand credit demand strengthens. In this context, continued diligence in supervision is important\\nespecially for banks with weaker asset qualities. Qatar Development Bank (QDB) initiatives to\\nsupport SMEs should be limited to viable but liquidity-constrained firms. Further increase in the\\nalready high sovereign-bank nexus calls for attention. Some banks have partly replaced their foreign\\nf\\nunding with public sector deposits, but access to such deposits is reportedly uneven, with smaller\\nbanks facing higher funding costs (Text Figure 13). The availability of public sector deposits could\\nalso be affected by hydrocarbon revenue volatility. To this end, the ongoing initiatives to deepen the\\ndomestic capital market would help banks diversify their funding sources. On the asset side, sizeable'),\n",

The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment on the exchange rate regime and\\nappreciated IMF TA on liquidity management. They emphasized the ongoing effort to build\\nc\\napacity and planned to progressively implement TA recommendations. The QCB noted that the\\nrecent policy interest rate cuts, slightly more than the US Federal Reserve’s, were motivated by a\\nrelatively wide interest rate differential to the Fed funds rate, domestic macroeconomic conditions\\n(growth normalization and low inflation), and excess liquidity in the financial system. They\\nhighlighted that the recent policy moves did not have any negative effects including on capital\\nflows, and future policy decisions would be data driven. The QCB acknowledged the need to further\\nimprove the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework but saw it as a medium-term\\nobjective. They agreed on the importance of communication and highlighted continued efforts to\\nenhance it.\\nD. Structural Reforms: B uild a Knowledge-Based and Sustainable Economy\\n28. Qatar’s vision to build a diversified, knowledge-based economy requires enhanced\\nhuman capital and output complexity (Text Figures 15 and 16). Staff analysis shows that human\\nc\\napital is not only a large, direct contributor to per-capita output, but also an amplifier of the\\ngrowth-enhancing impact of higher economic complexity.12 Physical capital has similar, albeit\\nsmaller, effects. When a country has high levels of human and physical capital, the amplification\\ne\\nffect (with economic complexity) on \\noutput is even stronger. Qatar has \\nbuilt a large capital stock with top-\\nnotch infrastructure quality, but its \\nlabor productivity and economic \\ncomplexity have substantial room to \\nimprove. Reforms should thus focus \\non: (i) building a highly skilled labor \\nforce, (ii) promoting innovation and \\nknowledge-spillovers (including \\nthrough FDI and trade diversification) \\nto boost economic complexity, \\nsupported by enhanced business \\nefficiency, (iii) leveraging Qatar’s \\nalready advanced digital access and AI \\nreadiness for further productivity \\ngains, and (iv) strengthening climate \\nsustainability and generating “green” \\ngrowth. \\n12 The Atlas of Economic Complexity is  a measure of the complexity of an economy’s product mix.

Qatar can build a future-ready labor force by:\\n• Attracting and retaining high-skilled expatriate workers. Qatar currently has more semi-\\nskilled expatriate workers than skilled or highly skilled ones (Text Figure 17). Analysis in the I MF’s\\n2023 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar suggests that increasing the share of more skilled\\nexpatriate workers can be a top contributor to growth. Intensified Kafala reform would further\\nenhance expatriate labor market protection and flexibility. Speedy implementation of newly\\nintroduced programs targeting higher-skilled expatriate labor (e.g., new visa schemes including\\na\\n five-year Mustaqel residence visa for foreign talent and entrepreneurs and a visa extension\\nprogram for graduating students to find jobs in Qatar) would improve labor force skills.\\nStrengthening the social safety net including the pension scheme would also help. The renewed\\n4-year collaboration program with ILO can support the authorities’ progress.\\n• En hancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector. Qatar’s education\\ni\\nnvestment is bearing fruit—more outcome-based education spending could help close the gap\\nwith OECD countries (Text Figure 17). Efforts should also strengthen to incentivize Qatari\\nnationals to join the private sector, especially the new graduates. A recently launched AI-based\\nplatform to match Qatari graduates with private sector jobs is a welcome initiative. To achieve\\nthe\\n NDS3 target of having 20 percent of Qataris employed in the private sector, effective\\ncoordination across public and private sectors, education institutions, and youth associations is\\nessential to align education with the private sector needs and ensure proper active labor market\\npolicies (e.g., reskilling and upskilling programs) to facilitate the nationals’ employment in the\\nprivate sector. As sectoral Qatarization targets are being set and government incentives for\\nprivate sector employers to hire Qatari nationals are being contemplated, potential benefits,\\nincluding savings on the public sector wage bill, should be balanced against risks, including skill\\nmismatches. It would be helpful to leverage the ILO’s expertise in setting sectoral Qatarization\\ntargets and active labor market policies.\\n5\\n20\\n90\\n4 15\\n10\\n22\\n48\\n10\\n6\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nEconomic\\ncomplexity x\\nphysical apital\\nEconomic\\ncomplexity x\\nhuman capital\\nEconomic\\ncomplexity, total\\nPhysical capital Human capital Total\\nSeries3Additional gains when initial human and physical capital\\nlevels are one standard deviation above mean'),\n",

Successful implementation of Qatar’s ambitious reform agenda hinges on proper\\np\\nrioritization, inter-agency coordination, effective execution, and careful management of\\npolicy spillovers. Many reform initiatives are in train to achieve NDS3 goals. They should be\\nproperly sequenced to prioritize more impactful reforms and explore synergies and\\nc\\nomplementarities. Inter-agency coordination is critical to ensure policy consistency and maximize\\nimplementation capacity. Incentives to various specialized economic zones and centers to promote\\nFDI and trade, as well as policy support to “diversification clusters,” should target well-identified\\ne\\nxternalities, market and coordination failures, or under-provision of public input—they are no\\nsubstitution for broad-based structural reforms. Diversification gains from economic zones and\\npriority sectors should be broadened to the wider economy by promoting stronger spillovers.\\nPeriodic cost-benefit assessments will help rationalize incentives and keep them time-bound.\\n32. Qatar is well positioned to leverage\\ndigitalization and AI (Text Figure 20). Qatar’s\\ndigital infrastructure, quality and affordability are\\ncomparable to those in advanced economies (AEs). \\nThe Digital Agenda 2030, launched in March 2024, \\nsets further ambitions in enhancing digital \\ninnovation, expanding e-government services, \\ndeveloping digital skills, and refining regulatory \\nframeworks. Qatar is also close to AEs in its AI \\nreadiness, and its labor market has a relatively \\nlarge share of jobs that can benefit from AI rather \\nthan being replaced, making the country well-\\npositioned to reap AI-driven productivity gains \\nwith limited job displacement risks (Box II). \\nEnhancing digital skills of the labor force, \\npromoting digital/AI penetration in production, strengthening cybersecurity risk management and \\nfacilitating job transitions are critical to fully benefit from digitalization and AI while mitigating labor \\nmarket risks. \\n33. Qatar has advanced its climate agenda further. In early-2024, Qatar raised $2.5 billion in a\\ndebut green deal under its new sovereign green financing framework. In June 2024, the QCB\\nl\\naunched the ESG and Sustainability Strategy for the financial sector to strengthen the financial\\nsystem’s capacity in supporting national sustainability goals. The share of energy capacity from\\nrenewables reached about 9 percent in 2023 against a target of 20 percent by 2030 (Text Figure 21).\\nThe NDS3’s emphasis on improving energy and water use efficiency is welcome. A concerted effort\\nis needed to achieve Qatar’s climate goals, including to gradually phase out remaining energy\\nsubsidies and reduce domestic energy price differentials from export prices, increase green\\ninvestment, promote climate financing, enhance interagency coordination, and upgrade the\\nregulatory framework.\\n14\\n14 See Annex VII. “Climate Risks and Actions in Qatar” of the 2022 Staff Report for Qatar, and Annex VII. “T he Impact \\nof Renewable Investment in Qatar” of the 2023 Staff Report for Qatar. \\nText Figure 20.

Overall, Qatar is \\nclose to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).  \\nIncreasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market. \\nCurrently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade), \\ncomparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent).

The authorities concurred with staff’s call to accelerate structural reforms, and noted \\nthat a large number of initiatives and projects were underway guided by NDS3. The newly \\nestablished National Planning Council highlighted its role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring inter-\\nagency coordination and monitoring progress. The authorities agreed with staff recommendation to \\nfocus reforms on boosting human capital and innovation, enhancing the business environment, \\nattracting FDI and promoting exports. They agreed that Qatar was well placed to leverage AI for \\nproductivity gains, and highlighted Qatar’s comparative advantage in energy cost and reliability to \\nattract data centers, around which an ecosystem could be built to enhance domestic value added. \\nBox 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded)\\n \\nThe private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar’s labor market toward a more \\nfavorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the \\nlast decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and \\ncomplementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country\\'s potential to \\nbenefit from AI adoption. \\n“Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching \\nthe occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with \\nthe AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure \\nand complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the “growth clusters” identified in NDS3—\\nmanufacturing, logistics, and tourism—tend to have more limited AI exposure.  \\nScenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff \\nanalysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital, \\ninnovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and \\nfaster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt \\nannually (above the baseline) over the medium term. \\n \\n  \\nSources: IMF staff calculations. \\n \\n1 This box summarizes key findings in the Selected Issues Paper “Artificial Intelligence in Qatar: Assessing the Potential \\nEconomic Impacts.” \\n2 Pizzinelli et al. 2023, \"Labor Market Exposure to AI: Cross-country Differences and Distributional Implications\" \\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 2027 2029\\nPessimistic\\nBaseline\\nOptimistic\\nVery optimistic\\nLabor Productivity by AI Scenarios\\n(Million GDP per worker)'),\n",

Enhancing D ata Adequacy\\n35. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps remain (Annex VII). The\\nauthorities are fully committed to meeting the IMF standards under the Enhanced General Data\\nDissemination System (e-GDDS). Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps\\nremain in the coverage and granularity of fiscal and external statistics, especially for the International\\nInvestment Position (including QIA positions), FDI and portfolio investment. The strong emphasis on\\ndata in NDS3 is encouraging, and the NPC is working to enhance inter-agency coordination for data\\nc\\nollection and dissemination. The IMF stands ready to support the authorities’ progress in data and\\nst\\natistics through capacity building.\\nAuthorities’ Views \\n36. The authorities welcomed the IMF’s initiative to strengthen data adequacy and agreed\\nwith staff assessment. They noted that the establishment of the national statistics center under the\\nNPC would enhance data collection and dissemination and expressed interest in collaborating with\\nthe\\n IMF, including through TA. The gaps in external sector statistics were well recognized, and the\\nNPC stressed that strong efforts were underway to enhance FDI data, which is also important for\\nmonitoring and assessing progress in NDS3 initiatives.\\nSTAFF APPRAISAL \\n37. Qatar has a favorable economic outlook and continues to demonstrate resilience to\\nexternal shocks. Recent indicators suggest that the post-World Cup growth normalization has\\nbottomed out and the gradual rebound in economic activities is gaining momentum. The medium-\\nterm outlook is more positive, driven by significant increases in LNG production and the anticipated\\nb\\nenefits from NDS3 implementation. By maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and\\na\\nccelerating reform efforts, Qatar can further solidify its resilience to shocks and prosperity.\\n38. The authorities’ commitment to sustain fiscal discipline can be supported by\\na\\nccelerated fiscal reforms. Adopting a PIH-based medium-term fiscal anchor can help ensure\\ni\\nntergenerational equity and guide a countercyclical fiscal policy. Accelerating revenue\\ndi\\nversification including to introduce the VAT would enhance revenue resilience and reduce the tax\\nrevenue gap. To support efficient NDS3 reform implementation and ensure fiscal sustainability, it is\\ni\\nmportant to enhance spending efficiency through rationalizing the wage bill and gradually phasing\\nout the remaining subsidies, and improve spending composition to facilitate the transition to private\\nsector-led growth. Gradually aligning domestic energy prices with export ones could generate\\nadditional revenue and support Qatar’s climate goals. The ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal\\ninstitutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged MTFF with enhanced fiscal risk management.'),\n",

Overview of Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy \\nThis Annex provides a brief overview of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which sets \\nthe priorities to build a knowledge-based and more sustainable economy. It stresses the state’s role as \\nan enabler of private sector-led growth, based on a candid assessment of the limitations and \\nchallenges associated with a state-driven growth model. \\n1. Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) aims for a transformation \\ntoward a private sector-led, knowledge-based, and more sustainable economy (Annex Figure \\n1-1). Issued in January 2024, NDS3 covers the last miles of Qatar’s National Vision (QNV) 2030. From \\nNDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar’s diversification strategy has gradually \\ntransitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the \\nprivate sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage \\nQatar’s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human \\ncapital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic \\ntransformation, with ambitious targets set.  \\n2. NDS3 highlights Qatar’s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision \\n2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and \\ninstitutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008–23 \\n(average 5½ percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10 \\npercentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar’s education and health systems, labor market including \\nfor expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements.  \\n3. NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar’s \\ndiversification journey. Qatar’s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC \\ncountries, especially in fiscal revenue and exports. NDS3 acknowledges relatively low non-\\nhydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification \\nmodel driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and \\nincentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and \\nhighly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains \\nless skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an \\nimmature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further \\ntransformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic \\ndiversification.  \\n4. NDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and \\nsustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close \\nremaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the \\nneed to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through \\nadditional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to \\nfacilitate private sector participation. It also identifies “diversification clusters” to build comparative \\nadvantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.'),\n",

A more sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework is envisaged, \\nsupported by diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 \\ntargets include to reach a fiscal surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (the past five-year-average was \\n3 percent), maintain the current sovereign credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and \\nachieve manageable expenditure growth (below the non-hydrocarbon output growth rate). The \\ngovernment plans to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, \\nand enhance debt management through frameworks including sovereign green financing. \\n• Human capital. The government will promote STEM education and upskill the Qataris. \\nInitiatives to attract high-skilled expatriate workers will include labor immigration reforms, \\nupskilling programs with private sector participation, and new visa schemes for elite talent and \\nentrepreneurs. The goal is for skilled labor force to exceed 46 percent of the total by 2030 \\n(currently at 28 percent), with 20 percent of the Qatari workforce in the private sector (currently \\nat 17 percent). \\n• Inclusiveness. Qatar aims at maintaining a high fertility rate (of 3 percent) and increase the \\neconomic participation of people with disabilities (to 30 percent by 2030). The government will \\nlaunch marriage and family support programs, enhance maternity leave, and promote financial \\nliteracy. For vulnerable segments, initiatives include better identification, skill development, and \\nexpanded social services. Women's empowerment and volunteerism (targeting a 10 percent \\nvolunteer rate) will also be key focuses. \\n• Health. Qatar targets a life expectancy of above 82 years and a 36 percent reduction in non-\\ncommunicable disease mortality by 2030. Key plans include healthcare infrastructure \\noptimization, lifestyle programs, and advancing patient care. The government will enhance \\nurban planning, cultural offerings, and public safety, aiming for fewer than 4.9 traffic deaths per \\n100,000 population. Satisfaction scores for residents and visitors are targeted to exceed 88 \\npercent.  \\n• Climate and sustainability. Qatar aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent \\nrelative to the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 and expand renewable energy capacity to \\n4 GW. The government will protect 30 percent of its land and marine areas, restore 30 percent of \\ndegraded natural habitats and reduce groundwater extraction by 70 percent, with per-capita \\nwater consumption below 310 liters per day. Plans include deploying carbon capture \\ntechnologies, expanding biodiversity protection, improving water conservation, and fostering \\ncircular economy practices.  \\n• Government efficiency. Qatar targets to rank in the top 10 percent on the Government \\nEffectiveness Index, with 90 percent of services digitalized by 2030. High satisfaction rates are \\nalso set to further reduce corruption and enhance satisfaction of public services. Reforms focus \\non strengthening digital capabilities, policy alignment, and performance management. Plans \\ninclude launching centralized performance tracking systems, improving data governance, and \\nenhancing accountability through more efficient and transparent government operations.\"),\n",

External Sector Assessment \\nOverall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately \\nstronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained \\nrobust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In \\n2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical \\nlevels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to \\nprogressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in \\nthe pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current \\naccount gap is expected to continue narrowing. \\nPotential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged \\nunder NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. \\nFiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and \\nspending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the \\nexternal position in the medium term.  \\nForeign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory \\nBackground1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and \\nlarge asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities \\nside, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but \\nrose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central \\nbank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.  \\nAssessment. On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are \\nestimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the \\nprojected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of \\nexternal public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt \\nSustainability Assessment). Commercial banks’ external liability remained broadly unchanged, leaving the \\nnet foreign liability relatively large.  \\n2023 (% GDP) NIIP: NA Gross Assets: \\nNA QCB Res. Assets: 24.2 Gross Liab.: NA Debt Liab.: 123 \\nCurrent Account \\nBackground. The current account surplus fell from a decade high in 2022, by nearly 10 percentage points of \\nGDP to 17 percent of GDP in 2023. Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export \\nvolume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance \\noutflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus \\nremained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and \\nimports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is \\nthus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of \\nGDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high, \\nalbeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices.'),\n",

Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by \\nfundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model \\nthat yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests \\na negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s \\nsignificant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment \\nmethodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume \\nvolatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts \\n(0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate \\nfurther in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied \\nby fundamentals and desirable policies.     \\nReal Exchange Rate \\nBackground. The Riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar \\nat 3.64 since July 2001. Qatar’s nominal effective exchange \\nrate (NEER) appreciated by 1 percent, similar to the US’s. \\nQatar’s real effective exchange rate (REER) weakened by \\n1 percent in 2023 as the nation’s inflation was below its \\ntrading partners’. In 2024 through November, REER \\ndepreciated somewhat from the same period in 2023.   \\nAssessment. With large reliance on hydrocarbon exports \\npriced in U.S. dollars and elastic supply of expatriate labor, \\nthe impact of REER performance on Qatar’s \\ncompetitiveness is limited. Based on the estimated CA gap \\nof 2.0 and an elasticity of 0.3, staff assesses REER as \\nundervalued by 5.6 percent. The EBA-lite REER model suggests an overvaluation of 13.6 percent. \\nCapital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures \\nBackground. The capital and financial account weakened in 2023. The composition shifted notably. Net \\nportfolio outflows rose by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to 15 percent of GDP, driven by portfolio \\ninvestments abroad (11 percent of GDP). In contrast, net other investment outflows declined by \\n16 percentage points to 1 percent of GDP. Overseas investment declined and net reduction in liabilities \\nmostly by commercial banks following the introduction of QCB measures, moderated. In 2024Q2, net \\nportfolio outflows abated while net incurrence of other investment liabilities resumed. \\n0\\n30\\n60\\n90\\n120\\n-20\\n-10\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n18 20 22 24 26 28 30\\nCA (% of GDP)\\nOil prices (right, US$ per barrel)\\nCurrent Account Balace and Oil Prices\\nCA model REER model\\nCA-Actual 17.1\\n\\xa0 Cyclical contributions (from model) (-) 0.9\\n  Natural disasters and conflicts (-) -1.1\\nAdjusted CA 17.3\\nCA Norm (from model) 15.4\\nCA Gap 2.0 -4.7\\n\\xa0 o/w Relative policy gap 2.0\\nElasticity -0.3\\nREER Gap (in percent) -5.6 13.6\\n1/ Based on the EBA-lite 3.0 methodology.\\n(in percent of GDP)\\nQatar: EBA-lite Model Results, 2023 1/\\n100\\n110\\n120\\n130\\n140\\n150\\n16 18 20 22 24\\nNEER, Qatar\\nREER, Qatar\\nNEER, US\\nEffective Exchange Rates\\n(2010 average = 100)'),\n",

Nowcasting of Non-hydrocarbon GDP Growth in Qatar \\nThis Annex applies nowcasting, which has been widely used for near-term growth projections, to \\nQatar’s real non-hydrocarbon output growth, with several innovations. Results fit historical data well \\nand point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. A few caveats related to the \\nmachine-learning approach for nowcasting are also discussed.  \\n1. Nowcasting generates real-time forecasts for key economic indicators where the \\nofficial data may be unavailable or delayed by analyzing high-frequency macroeconomic \\nindicators. For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy \\nmakers and businesses may need a more timely \\nassessment of the economy to inform policy and \\nbusiness decisions—nowcasting is an effective \\ntool to fill the gap. This technique is particularly \\nsuitable where high-frequency indicators are \\nabundant and published timely, as in the case of \\nQatar. Nowcasting models are also highly \\nadaptable—they can be updated regularly with \\nnew data, ensuring that the estimates remain \\nrelevant and accurate amidst changing \\neconomic conditions. \\n \\n2. A nowcasting model for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on \\nprevious IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps \\nbelow: \\n• Select predictive variables. A wide range of economic and financial indicators are selected to \\ncapture domestic, regional and global conditions that could affect Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon \\neconomy. These variables are chosen based on criteria such as predictive power (i.e., suggested \\nby the pairwise correlation between the predictive variable and Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP), \\ndata availability, and minimal lag time. A balance is maintained between the number of \\npredictors and the size of the training data (used to fit nowcasting models with historical trends) \\nto avoid overfitting – a situation where the model is too \"tailored\" to the training data and fails \\nto generalize to other situations, leading to inaccurate predictions. \\n \\n• Select nowcasting models. The selected time series data are processed through advanced \\nmachine learning algorithms (see below). A variety of models, including Support Vector \\nMachines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Elastic Net, are trained by historical data. Each model\\'s \\nperformance is evaluated using a range of metrics (e.g., out-of-sample root-mean-squared error \\n(RMSE)), and the best-performing models are selected for further analysis. \\n \\n• Identify contributions of predictive variables. Shapley decomposition is applied to break \\ndown the contribution of each variable to the nowcast results. This method allows us to pinpoint \\nFigure III.1.

A few innovations have been introduced to Qatar’s nowcasting framework to optimize \\nthe variable and model selections:  \\n• A big data approach in variable selection is developed to enhance the coverage of potential \\npredictors of economic growth and reduces the lag between real-world events and nowcasts. \\nUnlike traditional methods that select variables based on specific economic theories, this \\napproach collects a large number of variables including those that are unconventional in \\neconomic analysis, and evaluates their correlations with Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. \\nSpecifically, a Stata program is developed to scrape the Haver and CEIC databases, identifying \\nrelevant keywords in millions of data series. The keywords target data specific to Qatar and its \\nkey trading partners. The program chooses 1,300 Qatar-specific series and 1,200 series related \\nto Qatar’s trading partners for further selection. For the 2,500 variables, pairwise correlations are \\nrun against Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Those with the highest correlations (both positive \\nand negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari \\neconomy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to \\n13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley \\ndecomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative \\nvariables and iterate with alternative variables.  \\n• Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets. Unlike \\ntraditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better \\nintegration of complex, non-linear relationships between economic variables that ARIMA models \\nmight miss due to their linear structure and reliance on smaller, time-series data. ML models can \\nalso adapt to changing patterns in data more efficiently than statistical models. They can learn \\nfrom outliers, non-stationarity, and other irregularities, potentially yielding more accurate and \\ntimelier GDP nowcasts.\"),\n",

As the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas will likely \\nplay a key role for a smoother energy transition relative to fossil fuels \\nwith higher emission. Qatar\\'s production cost is low. These together \\nsupport sizeable revenues over a long term. \\n        \\n        \\n        \\nSustainability \\nassessment 2/ \\nNot required for \\nsurveillance \\ncountries \\nSustainable \\nwith high \\nprobability \\nNot applicable \\nDebt stabilization in the baseline Yes \\nDSA Summary Assessment \\nCommentary: Qatar is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress. Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen  \\nto, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support low fiscal and debt risk. The large reserves of natural gas, cleaner than \\nother browner fossil fuels, is likely to play a key role in a smoother energy transition, and strong financial buffers (including from the \\nsovereign wealth fund, QIA) can provide support if downside risks materialize. The projected non-hydrocarbon primary balance \\n(NHPB) is broadly consistent with the benchmark guided by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) in the long term (see the main \\ntext of the Staff Report). The authorities are in the process of producing own actuarial studies on the sustainability of the pension \\nsystem.  \\nSource: Fund staff. \\nNote: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt \\nrestructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt \\nrestructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing. \\n1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases or in cases with precautionary IMF \\narrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published. \\n2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt \\nsustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of \\nsustainable debt (\"\"with high probability\"\" or \"\"but not with high probability\"\") is deleted before publication.'),\n",

The shock could translate into higher global \\nhydrocarbon prices, but there is also the risk of LNG \\nexport disruption—the overall impact on Qatar is \\nhighly uncertain. Intensification of regional \\nconflict(s) could also weaken investor confidence \\nand disrupt supply chain, tourism, and capital flows.  \\nThe policy response would depend on the \\nnature of the shock.

Continue to \\nclosely monitor financial institutions. \\n \\nHigh High  \\nCommodity price volatility. Supply and \\ndemand fluctuations (e.g., due to conflicts, \\nexport restrictions, OPEC+ decisions, and \\ngreen transition) cause recurrent \\ncommodity price volatility, external and \\nfiscal pressures and food insecurity in \\nEMDEs, cross-border spillovers, and social \\nand economic instability.\\n \\nQatar’s ongoing LNG production expansion will \\nraise the economy’s sensitivity to energy price \\nvolatility. Higher-than-projected energy prices could \\nstrengthen fiscal and external positions, and non-\\nhydrocarbon output growth as ample hydrocarbon \\nliquidity and positive private sector confidence \\ncould boost consumption and investment. Pressures \\nto increase public spending could rise. Lower oil \\nprices would weaken the external and fiscal \\nbalances, and growth. \\nThe authorities should implement a medium-\\nterm fiscal framework which helps insulate \\npublic spending from oil price volatility. \\nDiversifying the revenue base toward more \\nnon-hydrocarbon sources would reduce \\nrevenue sensitivity to energy price volatility. \\nAccelerate structural reforms to advance \\neconomic diversification.\\n \\nMedium Medium  \\nGlobal growth downside surprise. Growth \\nslowdown in major economies, including \\ndue to supply disruptions, tight monetary \\npolicy, rising corporate bankruptcies, or a \\ndeeper-than-envisaged real estate sector \\ncontraction, with adverse spillovers through \\ntrade and financial channels, triggering \\nsudden stops in some EMDEs. (Low \\nprobability is assigned to surprise \\nacceleration in global growth). \\n \\nLower external demand reduces hydrocarbon export \\nprices, weakening fiscal and external positions which \\nare currently strong. Slower global growth would \\nalso weigh on domestic growth, affecting banking \\nsector asset quality. Global financial market \\ncorrections may lead to capital outflows and \\nincrease financial stability risks, including due to \\nbanks’ still sizeable exposure to foreign funding. \\n \\nQatar has fiscal space to respond to a major \\ngrowth slowdown. Fiscal policy should be \\nanchored in a medium-term framework to \\nreduce the risk of procyclicality. Continue to \\nclosely monitor banking sector developments \\nto maintain financial stability. Accelerate \\nstructural reforms to boost economic \\ndiversification and non-hydrocarbon \\npotential output. \\n \\nMedium Low  \\nMonetary policy calibration. Amid \\nelevated uncertainty and data surprises, \\nmonetary policy stances in major countries \\nturn out to be too loose, hindering \\ndisinflation, or too tight for too long than \\nwarranted, stifling growth domestically and \\nglobally, and increasing capital flow and \\nexchange rate volatility in EMDEs. \\nConsistent with the exchange rate peg, monetary \\npolicy in Qatar would closely follow that of the U.S. \\nAs domestic inflationary pressure remains low and \\ngrowth continues to normalize from the World Cup-\\ndriven boom, the risk that a too loose monetary \\nstance could de-anchor inflation expectations is \\nlimited. On the other hand, a monetary stance too \\ntight for too long than warranted could negatively \\naffect demand, but the ongoing public investment \\nand spillovers from the North Field LNG expansion \\nwill support growth.\\n \\nMaintain monetary policy and liquidity \\nmanagement that are consistent with the \\ncurrency peg. Continue to closely monitor \\nbanking sector developments to ensure \\nfinancial stability. If growth is negatively \\naffected by unduly tight (imported) monetary \\npolicy stance, some fiscal space could be \\ndeployed to provide targeted support while \\nmaintaining broad fiscal prudence. \\n \\nMedium Low  \\nSystemic financial instability. High interest \\nrates and risk premia, and sudden asset \\nrepricing amid economic slowdowns and \\npolicy uncertainty (including from elections) \\ntrigger market dislocations, with cross-\\nborder spillovers and an adverse macro-\\nfinancial feedback loop putting weak banks \\nand NBFIs under pressure. \\nTighter global financial conditions would increase \\ndebt service and financing costs, and increase the \\nliquidity risk for domestic banks reliant on foreign \\nfunding as banks’ net foreign liabilities remain \\nrelatively high. Such risks are however mitigated by \\nQatar’s large financial buffers, favorable market \\naccess, high sovereign credit ratings, and banks’ \\nreduced exposure to nonresident deposits.   \\nMaintain prudent financial sector policy and \\nclosely monitor risks and vulnerabilities \\nrelated to financial institutions, including \\nthrough stress tests and thematic inspections. \\nProvide liquidity to the financial system if \\nneeded, compatible with the currency peg. \\n \\n \\n1  The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path.

A recent IMF technical assistance provided a series of \\nrecommendations which the QCB is considering. \\nContain banks' exposure to foreign \\nliabilities. \\nA series of QCB measures have helped reduce banks’ short-term foreign \\nasset-liability mismatches. A comprehensive Third Financial Sector \\nStrategy was published, with plans to deepen domestic financial market \\nwhich would help boost banks’ domestic funding.  \\nContinue strengthening efforts to \\nenhance banking sector resilience. \\nFinancial safety net (deposit insurance, recover/resolution framework) is \\nbeing enhanced with IMF technical assistance. Measures to limit risks \\nfrom the real estate sector have been introduced.  \\nCarefully balance opportunities and \\nrisks around fintech and green financing \\ninitiatives with adequate regulations.  \\nA number of related areas are articulated in the Third Financial Sector \\nStrategy. Fintech sandboxes provide a controlled environment. The \\ndigital asset framework establishes a legal and regulatory foundation.  \\nImplement the FATF action plan in a \\ndecisive and coordinated manner. \\nThe authorities have submitted an action plan to implement FATF \\nrecommendations. A recent IMF diagnostic mission identified TA needs \\nand initiated a 2-year work program to strengthen the effectiveness of \\nthe AML/CFT framework. \\nStructural Reforms and Statistics \\nFocus further reforms on productivity, \\nbusiness environment, digitalization, \\nand climate actions. \\nReforms are being intensified guided by the Third National \\nDevelopment Strategy (NDS3) released in January 2024, which provides \\nan ambitious reform agenda to enhance human capital, productivity, \\nbusiness environment, and climate resilience.  \\nEnhance macroeconomic statistics by \\nimproving data quality, coverage, and \\ntimeliness, and by strengthening the \\ninstitutional framework for statistics. \\nThe National Planning Council (NPC) took over the former Planning and \\nStatistics Authority (PSA) in May 2024. The National Statistics Center is \\nestablished under NPC to strengthen statistics.

Data Issues \\nTable VII. 1. Qatar: Data Adequacy Assessment for Surveillance \\nRationale for staff assessment. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved. \\nNational accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by \\nexpenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter, \\nthe quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were \\nreleased in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).  \\nPrices. Monthly Consumer and Producer Price Indices (CPI, PPI), and real estate price data are published timely. CPI weights need to be updated more frequently. The \\nMinistry of Justice publishes Weekly Newsletter with daily property transaction data by type which can benefit from greater consistency to better inform surveillance.  \\nGovernment finance. The authorities are implementing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which enables compilation of accrual fiscal \\naccounts. An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the \\npublication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports \\ncould include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line \\nitems, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister \\nprovided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release. The coverage of financial \\noperations should be broadened to the general government including the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).  \\nExternal sector. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reports quarterly balance of payments data timely, following the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual (BPM5). \\nThe financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Stock Exchange. \\nHowever, financial account data are aggregated. The authorities need to improve coordination to enhance the coverage of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow data (which \\ndeviate significantly from FDI commitment data). A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly \\nInternational Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data \\nto the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar\\'s participation in key \\nsurveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).  \\nMonetary and financial sectors. The QCB submits the monetary and financial statistics (MFS) for the central bank and other depository corporations based on the \\nStandardized Report Forms (SRFs). The MFS data are published in the International Financial Statistics on a timely basis. Qatar also reports data on some key series and \\nindicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile money and the two indicators of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, but does not report data by \\ngender. The QCB reports the Financial Soundness Indicators as part of the National Summary Data Page, but does not submit to the IMF, and 4 indicators are missing \\nrelative to the IMF’s list of Core Financial Soundness indicators. \\nChanges since the last Article IV consultation. The Planning and Statics Authority was replaced by a newly established National Planning Council to strengthen reform \\nimplementation stipulated in the Third National Development Strategy, including to improve statistics. The statistics authority is in the process of producing new supply \\nand use tables to improve the consistency of GDP estimates. A household survey is being finalized, which will be used to update CPI weights. The domestic “FDI ecosystem” \\nhas been fully mapped to identify additional sources of input data including business registration platforms (i.e., QFC, QSTP, QFZA, Media city) which will increase survey \\nframe from current 130+ entities to 2000+ entities. \\nCorrective actions and capacity development priorities. Enhance awareness across government entities of the data gaps and international best practices. Implement \\nrecommendations made by the above-mentioned TAs. Encourage the authorities to seek the Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) training, additional Statistics \\nDepartments (STA) TAs, and participate in the workshop on the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to be organized by the newly established Riyadh Regional \\nOffice. Urge the National Planning Council and National Statistics Center to coordinate efforts across relevant government entities on statistics including consolidation of \\nscattered data, submission to the IMF, and broader publication.  \\nUse of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. IIP data are unavailable, including QIA’s assets under management. Staff \\nrely on different data sources as needed––it estimates external debt data (for non-bank private sector and public sector debt outside of the central government), uses \\nalternative data sources for FDI, and relies on commercially available bank-level data. \\nOther data gaps. A more granular forward-looking calendar of key data releases would aid surveillance and enhance transparency. By maturity assets and liabilities data \\nand by sector non-performing loans (NPLs) data will enhance the assessment of banking sector risks for surveillance. Data on enterprises, particularly small and medium-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs), and on climate change adaptation and mitigation would help inform surveillance.   \\nNational \\nAccounts Prices\\nGovernment \\nFinance \\nStatistics\\nExternal Sector \\nStatistics\\nMonetary and \\nFinancial \\nStatistics\\nInter-sectoral \\nConsistency Median Rating\\nB B B C B B B\\nCoverage B B B C B\\nB B C A\\nB B\\nConsistency B B B\\nFrequency and Timeliness B A B A A\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nData Quality Characteristics\\nGranularity 3/\\nData Adequacy Assessment Rating 1/\\nB\\nQuestionnaire Results 2/\\nAssessment\\nDetailed Questionnaire Results\\nNote: When the questionnaire does not include a question on a specific dimension of data quality for a sector, the corresponding cell is blank.\\n1/ The overall data adequacy assessment is based on staff\\'s assessment of the adequacy of the country’s data for conducting analysis and formulating policy advice, and takes into consideration \\ncountry-specific characteristics.\\n2\\n/ The overall questionnaire assessment and the assessments for individual sectors reported in the heatmap are based on a standardized questionnaire and scoring system (see IMF Review of the \\nFramework for Data Adequacy Assessment for Surveillance, January 2024, Appendix I).\\n3/ The top cell for \"Granularity\" of Government Finance Statistics shows staff\\'s assessment of the granularity of the reported government operations data, while the bottom cell shows that of public \\ndebt statistics.

After a very strong economic performance in 2022, boosted by the successful hosting of \\nthe 2022 FIFA World Cup, output growth has normalized in 2023 and 2024, with recent signs of economic activities \\nstrengthening at the end of 2024, notably in the tourism s ector. Qatar's inflation has been generally declining \\nthroughout 2023 and 2024. The medium-term outlook is positive, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion \\nand by reform efforts which are expected to intensify under the upcoming Third National Development Strategy as \\nwell as under the Third Financial Sector Strategy (3FSS) which is also expected to provide impetus for a sustainable \\ngrowth.  Qatar’s strong fundamentals and significant policy buffers would help mitigate any negative impact in case \\ndownside risks materialize. \\nFiscal Policy \\nThe State of Qatar’s low public debt, significant fiscal and external buffers, and the longer-term benefits and returns \\nof the authorities’ investment plans for future generation are remarkable. The authorities continue to be  fully \\ncommitted to a prudent fiscal policy that aim to optimize the use of Qatar’s resources by improving spending \\nefficiency and mobilizing non -oil revenue s, all whilst promoting sustainable growth and preserving \\nintergenerational equity. The 2024 budget was focused on allocating resources for the third National Development \\nStrategy (NDS3) and supporting efforts to diversify the economy. The general budget continues to focus on \\nachieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 related to the development of human capital by focusing on the \\nhealth and education sectors – with the allocations for the two sectors constitut ing 20% of the total budget - in \\naddition to the goals related to diversifying the local economy and enhancing its competitiveness. \\nThe authorities are committed to a sustainable, shock -resistant medium -term fiscal framework  supported by \\ndiversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 targets include to reach a fiscal \\nsurplus of 5½ percent of GDP (way above the past five-year-average of 3 percent), maintain the current sovereign \\ncredit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and achieve manageable expenditure growth. The government plans \\nto reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, and enhance debt management through \\nframeworks including sovereign green financing. The authorities intend to continue addressing underlying spending \\ninefficiencies and diversify fiscal revenues notably through implementing the corporate income tax Pillar II in line \\nwith the global timeline. The 2025 budget envisages broadly prudent spending plans and aims for a medium -term \\nexpenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have made good progress in expanding program -based \\nbudgeting to eventually cover all sectors by the end of 2025 and expect that the ongoing expenditure review would \\ngenerate savings in the medium term. Moreover, the authorities plan to enhance their macroeconomic projections \\nto support the medium -term budget update. The authorities view the fiscal risks from ongoing PPPs, mainly on \\noperating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be minimal.\"),\n",

The authorities agree with staff’s \\nassessment that the exchange rate peg continues to serve the Qatari  economy well. They appreciated the IMF \\ntechnical Assistance on liquidity management and plan to progressively implement its recommendations. The QCB \\naims to further improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework as a medium-term objective. \\nQatar’s banking sector is healthy, with strong capital buffers, sound liquidity and stable profitability. Furthermore, \\nQCB maintains a robust regulatory framework and conducts effective supervision to ensure the health of the sector \\nand to preempt any potential risks to financial stability. The QCB is committed to regular risk reassessment and the \\nnewly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened the assessment of emerging risks and early action. Banks are \\nwell prepared to manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were \\neffectively implemented to address potential risks. The micro and macroprudential measures, including the counter-\\ncyclical capital buffer, are  periodically reviewed, and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. \\nMoving forward, developments in Qatar’s financial sector will be further supported by the Third Financial Sector \\nStrategy (3FSS)  covering the period 2023 -2030. The strategy will be focusing on  governance and regulatory \\noversight; Islamic finance; digital innovation and advanced technologies; ESG and sustainability; and talent and \\ncapabilities, with the aim to create vibrant financial and capital markets that lead the region in innovation, efficiency, \\nand investor protection. “Based on a four-pillar approach - banking, insurance, digital finance, and capital markets \\n- the Strategy provides a roadmap for the financial sector in Qatar to unlock its full potential in line with Qatar \\nNational Vision (QNV) 2030. \\nQatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, as acknowledged by the 2023 AML/CFT mutual \\nevaluation report by FATF  which highlighted the strength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement \\nthrough improved risk assessment  capacity and clearer policy priorities. The QCB has also b anned financial \\ninstitutions to use crypto assets. The authorities remain firmly committed to strengthening the AML/CFT framework \\nin alignment with global standards, with a focus on risk- based supervision a nd effective enforcement to uphold \\nfinancial integrity and resilience. \\nStructural Reforms \\nThe Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024-2030 marks the final phase of the Qatar National Vision \\n2030. Since launching the National Vision in 2008, Qatar has made significant strides by leveraging energy sector \\nrevenues to build world -class infrastructure and institutions.  As a result, Qatar’s nonhydrocarbon economy has \\ngrown to account for about two- thirds of the total output , which underscores Qatar’s commitment to long -term \\neconomic diversification. \\nThe NDS3 , launched in January 2024,  aims to achiev e sustainable economic growth, e stablish a sustainable \\nmedium-term general budget framework with healthy levels of debt , provide a high standard of living to Qataris \\nand position Qatar as a global destination. The strategy  also aims at boosting human capital and innovation, \\nenhancing the business environment, attracting FDI and promoting exports. The establishment of the National \\nPlanning Council will have a significant role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring inter -agency coordination, and \\nmonitoring progress. \\nThe authorities have recently launched the Qatar National Manufacturing Strategy for 2024- 2030 aiming to drive \\nsustainable economic development, diversify key economic sectors, boost private sector  participation and \\ncontributions, advance manufacturing capabilities and strengthen Qatar’s economic competitiveness in regional and \\nglobal markets, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030.  Additionally, Qatar is targeting USD 100 billion in \\nforeign direct investment by 2030, while creating an investment clima te that will establish Qatar as a leading'),\n",
